## Hi there 👋

I'm a PhD student at Ghent University & IMEC on the topic of 5G and its absorption of EMF dosimetry for humans. I mostly work with Sim4Life (FDTD software developped by ZMT). In my personal time I am also interested in finance sometimes.

🌐 I have a small [personal website](https://www.robinwydaeghe.com/)

👯 Always open for collaborations!
